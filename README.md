# deduplication_practicals

This repository contains examples demonstrating how inter- and intra-VM memory deduplication may be leveraged for security-related tasks including virtualization detection and covert channel construction. 

This repository was developed as part of an initiative in the University of Delaware Electrical and Computer Engineering Department to develop hands-on labs to allow undergraduate and graduate students to learn the dynamics of attacks based on shared resources and aimed at information leakage.

Note that some portions of the code (cacheutils.h) are adapted from the excellent resources in an IAK [repository](https://github.com/IAIK/cache_template_attacks) demonstrating cache template attacks.
